# Data-Annotation
I have annotated 150 images containing various objects like car, pedestrian, traffic sign, bike, and motorbike in PASCALVOC format.

Full Overview:

1. Data Annotation and Dataset Preparation:
   ● Objective: Demonstrate the ability to accurately annotate images and prepare a dataset suitable for training a computer vision model. ● Task: ○ Annotate a provided set of 150 images containing various objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs). ○ Use annotation tools like LabelImg or CVAT to create bounding boxes around each object. ○ Ensure annotations are saved in a format compatible with common deep learning frameworks (e.g., Pascal VOC XML or COCO JSON). ● Deliverables: ○ Annotated images with corresponding annotation files. ○ A brief report (1-2 pages) detailing the annotation process, challenges faced, and how they were addressed.

2. Algorithm Development and Model Training: ● Objective: Assess the candidate's ability to develop and train a simple object detection model using the annotated dataset. ● Task: ○ Split the annotated dataset into training and validation sets (e.g., 80/20 split). ○ Implement a basic object detection model using a framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch. ○ Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the validation set. ● Deliverables: ○ Source code of the model implementation and training process. ○ A report (2-3 pages) summarizing the model architecture, training methodology, evaluation metrics, and results.

3. Research and Literature Review: ● Objective: Evaluate the candidate's ability to comprehend and summarize recent advancements in computer vision. ● Task: ○ Select a recent research paper (published within the last two years) related to object detection or a relevant computer vision topic. ○ Write a summary (1-2 pages) highlighting the research's key contributions, methodologies, and potential applications. ● Deliverables: ○ A written summary of the selected research paper.

4. Proof-of-Concept Demonstration: ● Objective: Assess the candidate's ability to develop a simple demo application with a user-friendly interface. ● Task: ○ Create a basic application that utilizes the trained object detection model to process live camera feed or video input. ○ Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) using a framework like Tkinter or PyQt to display the input feed alongside detected objects. ● Deliverables: ○ Source code of the demo application. ○ A brief user guide explaining how to run the application and interpret the results.
